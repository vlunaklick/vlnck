2022 is ending üçª! It's been a great year for me, filled with personal and professional growth. I got a job where I've been able to improve my skills, Argentina üá¶üá∑ won the World Cup üéâ, and my grades in college are high. My personal life is going great, and I feel very fortunate. I hope that this year has also been positive for all of you.

Today, I'm going to write down some of my goals (on the tech side) so that at the end of the year I can look back and see where I stand.

## Goals

Something I have been struggling with is `Typescript`. It's a great language, but it can be challenging at times. Since I work with Java in college and in my job, I could improve a lot in this area. I want to focus on it and have at least one "big" Typescript project by the end of the year.

As a matter of fact, this portfolio has been made with a bit of Typescript and my [Moofy website](https://moofy-commerce.vercel.app/) also, but I want new challenges.

Also, I think it will be a year where learning new frameworks will be vital. I have been working with React for a while now and I think it's time to learn something new. I have in mind `Astro`, `Svelte` and `Deno`, let me know if you have any other suggestions and what you think about these ones.

I've been reading about architecture patterns, but I haven't really applied them yet. I might include them in my Typescript project so I can combine them. I may also take a course on this topic.

One thing I have recently payed more attention to is the usage of Docker and Kubernetes in my work, but I don't know much about them. I think it would be a good idea to learn more about them, as it will help me in my job and in my personal projects. Along the same lines, I've been looking into Github Actions and think it could be powerful and easy to use, so I want to give it a try.

Finally, I want to start managing my time better. I've been using apps like Google Calendar and Notion to help, but I think I need to get a better balance between my personal and professional life.

## What I have learnt

At the beginning of the year 2022, I was focused on improving my skills so that I could land a job in the tech industry. I think I succeeded in that goal. I've rewritten almost all of my starter projects, learned a lot about databases, React, and Javascript, and gained valuable experience going through the interview processes.

After landing my job, I had the opportunity to learn Java with SpringBoot and AWS, and I started to get familiar with the backend world. But more importantly, I learned how to work in a team and how to communicate with others. I belive that that and improving my English skills are some of the most important things I've learned this year.

## Conclusion

I think that's all for now üòÖ. I hope you enjoyed reading this post and, since it's the end of the year, I wish you a great 2023 and I hope you can achieve all your goals. See you next year! üéâ
