2022 is ending üçª! It's been a great year for me, filled with personal and professional growth. I got a job where I've been able to improve my skills, Argentina üá¶üá∑ won the World Cup üéâ, and my grades in college are high. My personal life is going great, and I feel very fortunate. I hope that this year has also been positive for all of you.

Today, I'm going to write down some of my goals so that at the end of the year I can look back and see where I stand.

## Goals

Something I have been struggling with is `Typescript`. It's a great language, but it can be challenging at times. Since I work with Java in college and in my job, I could improve a lot in this area. I want to focus on it and have at least one "big" Typescript project by the end of the year.

As a matter of fact, this portfolio and my [Moofy website](https://moofy-commerce.vercel.app/) are also written in Typescript, yet I want new challenges.

Besides, I think it will be a year where learning new frameworks will be vital. I have been working with React for a while now and I think it's time to learn something new. I have in mind `Astro`, `Svelte` and `Deno`, let me know if you have any other suggestions and what you think about these ones.

I've been reading about architecture patterns, but I haven't really applied them yet. I might include them in my Typescript project so that I can combine them. Likewise, I may take a course on this topic.

Recently, I have become more interested in Docker and Kubernetes, although I don't have much experience with them. I believe that it could be valuable to learn more about these technologies as they can be useful in both my professional and personal projects. Similarly, I have been exploring Github Actions and I believe it could be a powerful and easy-to-use tool, so I plan on giving it a try.

Finally, I want to improve my time management skills. While I have been using apps like Google Calendar and Notion to help, I am not fully satisfied with the results. That said, I do feel like I have made progress in balancing my personal and professional commitments.

## What I have learned

At the beginning of the year 2022, I was focused on improving my skills so that I could land a job in the tech industry. I think I succeeded in that goal. I've rewritten almost all of my starter projects, learned a lot about databases, React, and Javascript, and gained valuable experience going through the interview processes.

After landing my job, I had the opportunity to learn Java with SpringBoot and AWS, and I started to get familiar with the backend world. But more importantly, I learned how to work in a team and how to communicate with others. I belive that that and improving my English skills are some of the most important things I've learned this year.

## Conclusion

I think that's all for now üòÖ. I hope you enjoyed reading this post and, since it's the end of the year, I wish you a great 2023 and I hope you can achieve all of your goals. See you next year! üéâ
