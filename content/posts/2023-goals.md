2022 is ending 🍻! A year in which I enjoy as much in the individual and colective side. I got a job where I am improving all my skills, Argentina won the World Cup 🇦🇷🎉, my grades in collage are great, my personal life is going great. I know I'm lucky and I hope to keep it that way and everybody else too.

Today, I'm going to write down all my goals (on the tech side) so at the end of the year I can rewind it and see where I stand.

## Goals

Something I have been struggling with is `Typescript`, what a great languague but hard at the same time. Since in collage and in my job I work with Java I could improve a lot in this area, but I need to really focus on it. Matter of fact, this portfolio has been made with a bit of Typescript, my [Moofy website](https://moofy-commerce.vercel.app/) also but I want new challenges. Maybe something where I hit an external API and I have to do some data manipulation, I really don't know what rigth now but I'm going to find it.
