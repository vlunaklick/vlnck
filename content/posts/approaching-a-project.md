description: Starting a new project can be intimidating, but having a clear plan in place can help set you up for success. This includes having a clear plan including what to build, tech choices, design, and organization. But what if you could take it one step further and achieve even greater success with your project?

Welcome back guys! In this post, we will talk about how I plan my first steps whenever I start a new project. Just for you to know, I have been developing for around a year, so maybe Iâ€™m not the most indicated person to give tips. I donâ€™t say this as a holy word! That being said, I hope it helps somebody as it helps me. Letâ€™s go!

## The idea

This may be the hardest part. What is going to be the brilliant idea that you are going to develop? If you are new in this world, one piece of advice I can give to you is to have a place where you can write all of your ideas. You really donâ€™t know how much you are going to miss them; it doesnâ€™t matter if you think itâ€™s not good, maybe it is but you donâ€™t know how to implement it yet.

Also, itâ€™s totally okay to search for projects and design a Tic-Tac-Toe or a to-do list but adding a bit of complexity will help you to improve your skills and portfolio. Having projects that make you defer from the rest, probably will add a bit more spiciness for the recruiters. Donâ€™t be afraid of copying famous apps such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. My most complex project is a WhatsApp clone and I still think it's dope.

Soon Iâ€™ll try to do Twitter, a dashboard or any other thing, wish me luck ðŸ˜€!

## Tech stack

Another hard question when you are starting a project. Do we use React or Angular? Maybe Svelte? There are so many options so it can be a problem at first. Change your perspective and start seeing things in this way, is it really necessary to implement a framework? Maybe what you need just requires HTML and JavaScript. If you can optimize, do it. The time awards you. If you really need it, evaluate what framework you will use.

By the way, probably with 1 year I canâ€™t even analyze those, my opinion is based on the things that coworkers or friends told me, and they are a lot more experienced than I am. I still think itâ€™s important that we make all these questions early so we donâ€™t make it harder in the middle.

## Planning

Maybe itâ€™s a bit redundant at this point, but make sure you do it. If you know what features you will be implementing before starting to code, you could save time and avoid using one that you donâ€™t like. If you are going to use a db, make a diagram so you can make sure that you donâ€™t leave anything out nor add something that is unnecessary. Knowing how the navbar should be, what modals you are going to need, if you will need to add a REST API, there are plenty of questions that will help you as a developer to improve your performance while doing the project.

## Design

This is probably directed towards frontends devs or anybody making a UI. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s correct but: design before you code. The first projects I have done were corrected because they may have worked correctly but if I show you the design, believe me, you will laugh. I donâ€™t recommend to:

> Do the design one time and stick to that.

I donâ€™t do that. Take this website as an example, it was created following a Figma design so I donâ€™t have to be changing the code all the time. If it wasnâ€™t made in that way, a simple design change will probably mean changes in all the code. Obviously, when you see it coded you may want to change something, and I think thatâ€™s also correct. How many things are correct on the first try? I just recommend that as a way to speed up the process.

## Coding

Is this the hardest/easiest part? I think here the streaks are real, one day you could be motivated and the other not, thatÂ´s also okay and it will be a topic that we will talk about in another post.

I think the best way here is to be organized. I donâ€™t know much about architectures but as far as I do, they will help you with scalability and organization. With this being said, I think that if you are making a small project you donâ€™t need to use it, but isnâ€™t it better to practice it so it is easier to implement it in future projects?

What I usually do is finish the bases of the app, make it work and then Iâ€™ll try to improve the code so it can be more readable and if I want to change something, itâ€™s easier than changing all the files for example. Of course, I donâ€™t intend to code as bad as I can but I can miss something, and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ll try to fix.

Iâ€™ll try to do a course or research about any architecture so I can make a post about that. I hope it goes well for me ðŸ˜€.

## To sum up

As you can see, I really want to optimize all because:

> If I manage what I do, thereâ€™s more free time to manage.

I think itâ€™s a very important thing and also it makes me donâ€™t relapse into the burnout.

I hope any of these tips help somebody, it will mean a lot. If you think something that I said is incorrect, you can send me an [email](mailto:v.lunaklick@gmail.com) or a message through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlunaklick/), Iâ€™ll be more than open to hear from you.

Thanks for your time
