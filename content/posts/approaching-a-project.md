Welcome back guys! In this post, we will talk about how I take my first steps whenever I start a new project. Just for you to know, I have been developing for around a year, so maybe Iâ€™m not the most indicated person to give tips. I donâ€™t say this as a holy word! That being said, I hope it helps somebody as it helps me. Letâ€™s go!

## The idea

This may be the hardest part. What is going to be the brilliant idea that you are going to develop? If you are new in this world, one piece of advice I can give to you is to have a place where you can write all of your ideas. You really donâ€™t know how much you are going to miss them; it doesnâ€™t matter if you think itâ€™s not good, maybe it is but you donâ€™t know how to implement it yet.

Also, itâ€™s totally okay to search for projects on the web. Design a Tic-Tac-Toe or a to-do list could be great, but adding a bit of complexity will help you to improve your skills and portfolio. Having projects that make you defer from the rest, probably will add a bit more spiciness for the recruiters. Donâ€™t be afraid of copying famous apps such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. My most complex project is a WhatsApp clone and I still think it's dope.

## Tech stack

Another tough question when you're starting a project is choosing the right framework. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming at first. One way to approach this decision is to consider whether you actually need to use a specific framework, and if not, choose the one that is simpler and less complex. Of course, there may be other considerations to take into account as well.

As I have only been programming for about a year, I am not yet able to thoroughly analyze the various frameworks on my own. My opinions on this matter are based on what my more experienced coworkers and friends have told me. However, I do believe it is important to ask these questions and make these decisions early on in the project to avoid complications later on.

## Planning

It may seem redundant, but it is important to plan ahead before beginning to code. By knowing the features you will be implementing beforehand, you can save time and avoid using a framework that may not be suitable for your needs. If you are planning on using a database, consider creating a diagram to ensure that you don't leave anything out or add unnecessary elements. By considering these details and asking these questions beforehand, you can better plan and organize your project, resulting in improved performance and efficiency as a developer.

## Design

This is probably directed towards frontends devs or anybody making a UI. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s correct but: design before you code. The first projects I have done were corrected because they may have worked correctly but if I show you the design, believe me, you will laugh. I donâ€™t recommend to do the design one time and stick to that. Take this website as an example, it was created following a Figma design so I donâ€™t have to be changing the code all the time. If it wasnâ€™t made in that way, a simple design change will probably mean changes in all the code. Obviously, when you see it coded you may want to change something, and I think thatâ€™s also correct. How many things are correct on the first try? I just recommend that as a way to speed up the process.

## Coding

Is this the hardest/easiest part? I think here the streaks are real, one day you could be motivated and the other not, thatÂ´s also okay and it will be a topic that we will talk about in another post.

I think the best way here is to be organized. I donâ€™t know much about architectures but as far as I do, they will help you with scalability and organization. With this being said, I think that if you are making a small project you donâ€™t need to use it, but isnâ€™t it better to practice it so it is easier to implement it in future projects?

What I usually do is finish the bases of the app, make it work and then Iâ€™ll try to improve the code so it can be more readable and if I want to change something, itâ€™s easier than changing all the files for example. Of course, I donâ€™t intend to code as bad as I can but I can miss something, and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ll try to fix.

Iâ€™ll try to do a course or research about any architecture so I can make a post about that. I hope it goes well for me ðŸ˜€.

## To sum up

As you can see, I really want to optimize all. I think if I can manage what I do, thereâ€™s more free time to manage.

For me, itâ€™s a very important thing and also it makes me donâ€™t relapse into the burnout.

I hope any of these tips help somebody, it will mean a lot. If you think something that I said is incorrect, you can send me an [email](mailto:v.lunaklick@gmail.com) or a message through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlunaklick/), Iâ€™ll be more than open to hear from you.

Thanks for your time
