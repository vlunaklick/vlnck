Hello everyone! My name is Valent√≠n and I'm a full-stack developer with a focus on frontend development, although I'm currently working more on the backend side. I began programming about a year ago and initially threw myself into it, studying intensely for three months while also attending college. However, I eventually experienced burnout and took a break. By the end of 2021, I resumed my journey in programming, improving on old projects and learning new skills like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and more.

I created this blog to share my experiences and thoughts as I continue learning and growing as a developer. It also gives me the opportunity to improve my writing skills and expand my vocabulary, as English is not my native language.

That's all for now. I hope you enjoy reading my posts and stay tuned for updates as I share my journey with you.

Thanks for your time,

vlnck
