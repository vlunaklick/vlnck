Welcome! This is going to be the first post in my _new blog_, here I’m going to post my path as a developer and some curious facts and moments of my life. So, for you to know me a bit better, I’m a full stack developer working more for the backend side, but I still do frontend in my regular days since I really like it and I don’t want to lose my “skills”, ~~if you can call them like that~~ 😂. I started programming 1 year or so ago, I rush it as fast as I could for 3 months while doing collage, moment where I got the famous “burnout” 🥵 and, by the end of 2021, I resumed my journey improving old projects.

This new one will help me to improve my vocabulary, the way I dwell and also to make a kind of diary so I can see my journey in a future.

That’s it for now, I hope you have a great time reading all the things I’m going to publish here.

Thanks for your time,

vlnck
